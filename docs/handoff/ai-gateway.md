# AI Gateway Handoff

**As of:** 2026-10-15

Part of the coaching platform program:
[`docs/plans/coaching-platform-2026-10/README.md`](../plans/coaching-platform-2026-10/README.md).
Read it first; it holds the contracts, file owners and migration codes.

## Goal

Every AI call goes through one provider-neutral gateway (Contract 1). Claude Haiku 5.5 and Sonnet 5.5 replace DeepSeek and Groq at cutover; the old routes stay available by settings for two weeks.

## Chunks

A1, A2 (Phase 1); A3–A7 (Phase 2)

## State

No chunk of this stream has merged yet.

**A1 (review, draft PR #103, migration `20261015120011_provider_neutral_ai.sql`):**

- In SQL a provider is the vendor that receives the data (`anthropic`, `deepseek`, `groq`,
  `gemini`, `mock` for runs), never `openai_compatible` (lead decision, Contract 1 v2). Every SQL
  provider list accepts `anthropic` next to today's names:
  `model_runs` and `ai_usage_events` provider checks, `ai_usage_events_model_check`,
  `meal_photo_ai_notices_provider_check`, and the RPCs `persist_coach_chat_result`,
  `persist_daily_coaching_result_v2`, `persist_failed_coaching_run_v2`,
  `persist_failed_coach_chat_run` (`_v2` wraps it), `record_ai_usage_event`,
  `persist_meal_photo_candidates`. Old vision vendors keep pinned models; `anthropic` accepts any
  well-formed model id. No frozen function holds a provider list.
- `ai_consent_notices.provider` and `photo_ai_notices.provider` (nullable; old notices null).
  Publish with `private.publish_ai_notice(version, provider, provider_label, purposes, body)` and
  `private.publish_photo_ai_notice(version, provider, provider_label, model, body)`.
- `get_ai_consent_v2(target_user_id, consent_purpose)` → `{schema_version, granted, provider,
  notice_version}`; TS `aiConsentWithProvider(rpc, userId, purpose)` → `{consent, provider,
  noticeVersion}`, `provider` typed `AiVendor`. Purpose mapping: AI_SAFETY_SPEC §10.
- `reserve_ai_budget_v2(target_user_id, run_purpose, ceiling_usd)`, ceiling in (0, 0.50]; TS
  `AiBudget.reserve(purpose, ceilingUsd)`. Feature names map to today's purposes (COST_MODEL).
- Until a notice naming the route's provider is published and granted, `get_ai_consent_v2` returns
  `provider: null` for coaching and physique notices, so a gateway call would refuse. Cutover (A7)
  publishes those notices.
- Open: a `library_context` model call would need its own usage purpose in `model_runs` or
  `ai_usage_events` (today it is budgeted and consented as `coach_chat`). Vision through DeepSeek,
  or a Groq or Gemini model other than the pinned ones, still needs a migration (A3).
